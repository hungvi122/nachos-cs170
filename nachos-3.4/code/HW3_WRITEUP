We have implemented the first parts of the project. We 
believe that the vm part *should* work... We have honestly 
done very minimal testing as simply completing the project 
has been so time consuming. We know that everything compiles.

We used LRU repalcement instead of a FIFO with second chance 
because it was easier to implement. Even though a FIFO queue
generally has better performance.

to compile:
gmake

to test:
same commands as before
